					It's been very tricky for us to get our heads around this
					bit having lived together for so many years but many of you
					have been very kind and asked about a wedding gift list.
				</p>
				<p>
					We thought it could be lovely to mark our vows to each other
					by finding a piece of art for our bedroom that is seriously
					in need of a refresh. So we have set up a funding page (see
					link below) and hope everyone will be happy for us to split
					some of the gift fund with an Eco charity that we would like
					to support as well. We have it on good authority (thanks
					Sam) that The Centre for Alternative Technology is making an
					important, climatic impact within education and research,
					and also very 'cool'.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no expectation to buy us a gift for our wedding,
					all the best wishes so far have been overwhelming but hope
					this helps if you would like to buy us a gift.
